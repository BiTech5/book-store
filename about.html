            <p>Founded in 2025 as a college project, our bookstore began as a small local initiative with a simple
                mission: to bring the joy of reading to our community. What started as an academic idea has now grown
                into a beloved destination for book lovers of all ages.</p>
            <p>We believe that every book has the power to transform lives, spark imagination, and create connections
                between people. Our carefully curated collection spans across genres, from timeless classics to
                contemporary bestsellers, ensuring there's something for every reader.</p>
